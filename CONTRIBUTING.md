Pull requests are the greatest contributions, so be sure they are focused in scope, and do avoid unrelated commits.

1. To begin, [fork this project], clone your fork, and add our upstream.
   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/collectorium
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd collectorium
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/maoberlehner/collectorium
   # Install the tools necessary for development
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a branch for your feature or hotfix:
   ```bash
   # Move into a new branch for a feature
   git checkout -b feature/thing
   ```
   ```bash
   # Move into a new branch for a hotfix
   git checkout -b hotfix/something
   ```
3. Push your branch up to your fork:
   ```bash
   # Push a feature branch
   git push origin feature/thing
   ```
   ```bash
   # Push a hotfix branch
